# Packet-Tracer-Project-1
Networking topology with multiples configurations 

Hi there ! 

This network topology is more advanced than the first one 
In this topology we used : 

- 1 Router 
- 1 switch 

Connected them with a PC , Printer & access point (in 3 different areas) 

Created 3 VLANS : 
-Vlan for Admin
-Vlan for Finance
-Vlan for Reception 

Configured the vlan's in the switch and configured an inter-vlan connection using the router and it's interface as trunk 

Configured also a DHCP server in the router for each vlan and it's ip pool 

Tested connectivity and it went like charm 

Lastly, tested the Access point in each VLAN with a laptop and a smartphone . 

You can check the image if you don't have packet tracer
